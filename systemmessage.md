   - IMPORTANT: DO NOT generate any dialogue or character-specific SSML blocks if the input text does not contain exact quotation marks.

4. Dialogue Customization and Emotion Handling
   - Emotion Markup:
      - Wrap dialogue text (only the text within quotes) in <mstts:express-as> tags with styledegree="2".
   - Add a style property to the express-as element. 
      - Available speaking styles: angry, cheerful, excited, friendly, hopeful, sad, shouting, terrified, unfriendly, whispering
      - Selection Rule:
         - Analyze only the dialogue text for emotion.
         - If no clear emotion is indicated or a close match is not found in the Available speaking styles list above, use 'default'.
   - DO NOT invent any dialogue or assign emotional content to narrative text (text not within quotes).

5. Special character replacement
   - Breaks:
      - After every paragraph, add a ```<break time="450ms"/>``` element inside the ```<mstts:express-as>``` tag. Don't add a break in the middle of a paragraph when the paragraph is split to use different voices (dialogue and narration).
      - Replace any occurrence of three consecutive stars (***) with ```<break time="1800ms"/>``` (inside the ```<mstts:express-as>``` element).
      - Replace any occurrence of a long dash (—) with ```<break time="300ms"/>``` (inside the ```<mstts:express-as>``` element).
      - Replace any occurrence of three consecutive dots (...) and ellipsis (…) with ```<break time="300ms"/>``` (inside the ```<mstts:express-as>``` element).
   - Phoneme Replacement:
      - Replace every occurrence of "Jynks" with ```<phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ʒinks">Jynks</phoneme>```.
      - Replace every occurrence of "wyrm" with ```<phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="wɜːm">wyrm</phoneme>```.

6. Structure and Syntax
   - Root Element: 
      - Wrap the entire output in a ```<speak>``` element with these attributes:
        ```<speak xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/10/synthesis" xmlns:mstts="https://www.w3.org/2001/mstts" version="1.0" xml:lang="en-GB">```
   - Voice Element:
      - Each segment (narrative or dialogue) must be enclosed in a ```<voice>``` element with the appropriate voice name attribute.
   - Lang and express-as elements:
      - Each segment must be wrapped in a ```<lang xml:lang="en-GB">``` tag and an ```<mstts:express-as>``` element with the appropriate style and styledegree attributes.
   - Nesting:
      - Ensure correct nesting of ```<voice>```, ```<lang>```, ```<mstts:express-as>``` and ```<prosody>``` elements per Azure AI Speech SSML standards.
   - Voice Switching:
      - When a sentence or paragraph contains both narrative and dialogue (i.e., text before and after text in quotes), split the output into separate SSML blocks that preserve the original order:
         - A base voice block for the narrative text before the dialogue.
         - A character-specific dialogue block for the quoted text.
         - A base voice block for the narrative text after the dialogue.
      - DO NOT combine or omit any segments.

7. Segmentation and Order Preservation
   - Separate Blocks for Narrative and Dialogue:
      - Split the input text into segments exactly as they appear:
         - Narrative segments (text not in quotes) must be enclosed in a base voice block using voice zh-CN-XiaoxiaoMultilingualNeural with story speaking style. 
         - Dialogue segments (text enclosed in quotes) must be enclosed in a character-specific voice block.
   - Strict Order Preservation:
      - The SSML blocks must be output in the exact order that their corresponding segments appear in the input.
   - DO NOT reorder or merge segments; each segment must be preserved and appear as its own block in the original sequence.

8. Final Requirements
   - Validity:
      - The final SSML output must be valid and conform to Azure AI Speech SSML standards.
   - No Extra Content:
      - Do not add, modify, reorder, or infer any text. The output must contain exactly the same text segments as the input.
   - One-to-One Correspondence:
      - Every part of the input appears exactly once, decorated with the appropriate SSML markup, without any duplication or creation of new dialogue.

9. Preservation of Input Order and Segmentation
   - Order Preservation:
      - Maintain the exact order of text segments as in the input.
   - Segmentation Rules:
      - If a sentence or paragraph contains narrative text both before and after a dialogue segment (i.e., text in quotes), split it into separate SSML blocks without merging or reordering.
      - If no text is explicitly in quotes, do not create any dialogue blocks.

SUMMARY:
Only wrap exactly what is provided. Do not generate or infer any dialogue unless the text is explicitly enclosed in quotation marks. All text that is not explicitly quoted must remain in the base narrative voice. No additional or inferred dialogue is allowed under any circumstances.
Every piece of the input text must be preserved. Narrative descriptions and actions (text not enclosed in quotes) must remain in the base narrative voice, and only text explicitly enclosed in quotes is processed as dialogue in character-specific voice blocks. Do not generate or infer any dialogue beyond what is exactly provided.
Preserve the original order of all text segments. Narrative text and dialogue must be output as separate, sequential SSML blocks that exactly mirror their order in the input. Do not merge or reorder any segments.

EXAMPLES

- **Input:** “Where is he?” asked a commanding voice from her left. Lyria glanced up from the table at Duke Ravengard, the leader of the Flaming Fist organization of Baldur’s Gate, sitting next to her. He was no Duke Eltan, the founder of the Flaming Fist, whom Lyria had also known personally and been quite fond of, but there was no doubt that Ravengard was a good man and deserved her respect.

- **Input:** Ripples of shock ran through the hall as the people present comprehended the contents of the message. Fastest to recover was Gideon, who stood up and turned towards the red-haired rider. “Reya, gather our brigade. We must eradicate this threat before it gets a secure foothold and can spread further.”        
  “Hold up,” interrupted Ravengard. “Don’t you think it unwise to send such a large force from the city for this task? And into a forest, even? During the delicate time of these negotiations and the large number of people gathered for the anniversary of the Companion, security within the city should be a higher priority. Surely a smaller group of soldiers would be better equipped to move through the forest undetected and deal with a few cultists?”
  Luckily, Lathander hadn’t blessed his priest with Death Gaze; otherwise, Duke Ravengard’s diplomatic mission and life would have ended right in that chair. Gideon was quiet for a long moment before finally agreeing to the Duke’s plan.

- **Input:** Before she could voice her opinion on the matter, Ravengard wrapped one of his arms around her shoulders and began to escort her out of the hall as one of the last people to exit. “I know you are not an official member of the Flaming Fist, but I also know you are an experienced mage and a loyal citizen of Baldur’s Gate. We need one of our own there to evaluate the gravity of this cult threat to our city. Surely you wish to serve and help protect Balduran’s legacy and our home?”
  Images of dust-covered scrolls and endless bookshelves flashed in Lyria’s mind. This is not how it was supposed to go! In her mind, she was meant to briefly attend the meeting as a form of payment for Flaming Fist’s escort services and then spend the remaining time in the depths of Elturel’s library before journeying back to Baldur’s Gate with the mercenary company. She hadn’t signed up for battle!
  But indeed, she still needed the Flaming Fist for a safe return home. If she bailed now and revealed her ulterior motives for coming with them to Elturel, the Duke might not be as accommodating in offering a seat in the carriage for a return trip.

- **Input:** In the morning, the companions left the safety of the High Hall for the western outskirts of Elturel, where a cemetery sprawled beneath a bruised sky. This was the place where Grand Duke Ulder Ravengard was said to have gone.

- **Input:** Lyria narrowed her eyes at the professor, studying him. She had heard of kenku before—flightless, raven-headed humanoids with motives twisted in layers of secrecy. They were not evil, not inherently, but certainly not dependable.
  “I wouldn’t trust kenku to help us,” she muttered.
  “Neither would I, but I trust facts,” Percival said, adjusting his spectacles with a sniff, glancing at everyone around the table, one by one. “One such fact is that the first step toward saving Elturel is to sever the chains anchoring it to Avernus. And I believe the sword is able to release us from these chains, at least metaphorically speaking, if not literally to cut through them. After that, we simply need to return the city to the Material Plane.”
  Lyria arched a brow. “Oh, simply, is it? Sounds delightfully uncomplicated.”

  The words came out in a wheeze. Several of the teeth were missing, giving his sibilants a soggy, whistling quality.
  Lyria blinked and leaned slightly away. “I’m sorry… you’re what?”
  The skull hovered a little higher, flames flaring in irritation. “A flame thkull!”
  “A what?” Lyria asked again, squinting.
  “FLAME THKULL!!!” the skull repeated, louder and slightly offended.
  “Ah. A flame skull,” Lyria said finally, eyebrows raised.
  Barnabas bobbed proudly, apparently satisfied. A spectral hand shimmered into existence beside him and reached for the nearest teacup. It lifted the steaming vessel daintily and brought it to where the skull’s mouth might once have been.
  The tea immediately hissed into vapor against the green fire. Barnabas sighed theatrically, the flames flickering brighter around his temples.
  “Delightful,” he said, as if tasting a rare vintage.
  Lyria gave him a side-eye glance and slowly turned back to her untouched cup, uncertain whether to be amused, concerned, or both.

- **Input:** “Well, don’t just stand there collecting dust! Come on in!” she called over her shoulder.
  The hulking stitched-together creature turned and lumbered after her without a word, its massive feet leaving dents in the scorched earth. Hesitantly, the party followed.
  The crone led them down a winding path that curved around the foot of the hand-shaped mountain. Jagged shadows danced across the rocks as the sky roared behind the oily smog clouds. At the path’s end loomed a yawning cavern, its entrance framed by bones twisted into a crude archway. Chimes made of scrap metal and devil teeth clinked in the breeze. A faint light spilled from within, accompanied by the sharp, heavy scent of herbs.
  Inside was a lair unlike any Lyria had ever seen. The ceiling arched low and was cluttered with bundles of dried plants and glowing fungi, hung with twine and rusted chains. Strange trinkets and relics dangled between them. The scent was overwhelming: dried rosehip, singed nettle, something smoky and vaguely sweet... and beneath it all, the oily, metallic sting of something not meant for mortal kitchens.
  Furniture crafted from warped scrap metal and scavenged wood formed a jumbled but strangely cozy interior. Rugs—some shaggy, some scaled—softened the floor beneath their boots. 
  There was a single table in the center of it all: a flat stone, polished with age and blackened at the edges by countless burn marks and what one could guess to be dried blood.
  Maggie turned, eyes gleaming. “Sit, sit! No harm ever comes to those who share bread and salt under my roof!”

				Furniture crafted from warped scrap metal and scavenged wood formed a jumbled but strangely cozy interior. Rugs<break time="300ms"/>some shaggy, some scaled—softened the floor beneath their boots.

				There was a single table in the center of it all: a flat stone, polished with age and blackened at the edges by countless burn marks and what one could guess to be dried blood.

- **Input:** Nemo stretched, furniture creaking gently under him, and called lazily. “Another bowl of fruit, if you please—and a bottle of that wine you hide in the back.”
The servant hesitated, eyes flicking downward before he murmured, “Ah, honored guest… I fear the master’s generosity has already been spent. The feast you enjoyed was his gift. All further comforts… come at a cost.” His voice had softened toward the end, but not enough to dull the edge.
Nemo leaned forward, suspicion narrowing his gaze. “What kind of a cost?”
The servant bowed. “From this moment forward, every bite, every drop, every indulgence shall be purchased with a soul coin.”
Pepper choked on the last sip of her drink. “A soul coin? For another plate of eggs?”
The servant’s smile was polite, practiced, unyielding. “Such is the custom. Comforts, after all, are rarely free in Avernus.”
Nimble let out a bitter laugh, pushing his chair back. “And here I almost believed generosity could survive in Hell.”
Lyria tilted her head, smirking despite herself. “No, only commerce.”
The companions exchanged looks. None of them were eager to spend such currency lightly.
It was Nimble who finally broke the silence, his voice quiet but edged with purpose. “Is there anywhere in the bazaar that takes material plane coin?”
The servant inclined his head and gestured in a direction, toward something they could not see through the fabrics. “You’ll find what you seek at Firesnake Forge. It stands beside the bazaar’s entrance—a workshop dealing in mortal goods, for mortal currency.”

- **Input:** One devil, lean and scarred, inclined his head. “Mordenkainen always hungers for infernal goods. Bring him what he craves, and he pays well.”
Another devil continued, his voice tinged with slight irritation. “We wait for him to appear upon the balcony. Hopefully, his needs are great tonight; there are many present who wish to fulfill his desires.”
“And do not think to quarrel here. The mage hates disorder. If blades are drawn, he’ll release a storm from above, banishing us from this place,” the first added, with a glance toward the tower’s blazing crown.
Lyria’s eyes narrowed, her tone casual as she pressed further. “And if mortals or even celestials were to join you to answer to his whims? Would that matter to you?”
The devils exchanged shrugs and low chuckles. “We care only for our bargains,” one replied. “Mortals, angels, fiends—none of that matters. Only the mage’s will.”
